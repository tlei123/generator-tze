[WORK IN PROGRESS!  Not published to NPM yet!]
When this Generator's released & installable from NPM, you'll know from this ReadMe markdown.

This is a customer "basic" Yeoman Generator with just the Node Modules I need for simple web applications:

 * grunt-contrib-sass
 * grunt-contrib-jshint
 * grunt-contrib-watch
 * grunt-contrib-clean
 * grunt-contrib-copy
 * grunt-contrib-concat
